# Triangle

###Object Oriented Ruby | a Triangle class that includes methods for initializing new triangles and determining what triangle type.

When your unit testing on your Triangle class is complete, make a web page that lets the user input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and tells whether they form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle.

#### Here are the Triangle rules you'll need:

* equilateral: all sides are equal;
* isosceles: exactly 2 sides are equal;
* scalene: no sides are equal.
* NOT a triangle: the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
